# 📊 Analyze the impact of COVID-19 across various regions and demographics.

## 📝 Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to understand the impact of the pandemic across different countries and demographics. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project performs data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and visualization to highlight key trends and insights.

## ✨ Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed COVID-19 datasets to ensure data quality.
- Descriptive statistics to summarize confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases.
- Visualizations including:

    * Bar charts for comparing top affected countries.
    * Pie charts for distribution of cases.
    * Line plots for trends over time.
    * Box plots for death rate distributions.

- Exploratory and comparative analysis to identify patterns and correlations.

## 📈 Data
Data is collected globally and organized by country/region
The dataset includes:
- Confirmed cases 
- Deaths 
- Recoveries 
- Active cases (calculated as Confirmed - Deaths - Recovered)

## 🔎 Example Analyses 
- Average confirmed cases per country 
- Death rate percentage globally 
- Countries with the highest average deaths and active cases 
- Correlation analysis between confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases 
- Trends of confirmed cases in the most affected countries

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
